    <h3>Ingridients</h3>

        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> A hearty mix of sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef gives this lasagna its rich, meaty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> Chopped onion and a couple of garlic cloves are sautéed with the meat to add depth and aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato base:</strong> The sauce comes together with crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste for a full-bodied taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A touch of white sugar balances the acidity of the tomatoes and enhances their natural sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs and spices:</strong> Fresh parsley, dried basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper create a well-rounded, savory flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use your favorite lasagna noodles, whether store-bought or homemade.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> A generous blend of Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta makes the dish extra rich and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Mixing an egg into the ricotta helps hold the cheese layer together when sliced.</li>

    </ul>

    
    <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat & Prep</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat oven to 190°C / 375°F.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease a 9×13-inch (23×33 cm) baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Gather cheeses: about 425 g (15 oz) ricotta, 450 g (16 oz) mozzarella (sliced or shredded), ¾ cup (75 g) Parmesan. Beat 1 egg into the ricotta with ½ cup Parmesan, 2 Tbsp parsley, a pinch of salt & pepper; set aside.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Make the meat sauce</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large pot over medium-high, brown ~1 kg total meat (half sweet Italian sausage, half lean beef) for 6–8 min, breaking it up. Spoon off excess fat, leaving about 1 Tbsp.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 chopped onion + ½ tsp salt; cook 5–7 min until translucent.</li>
                    <li>Stir in 2–3 minced garlic cloves for 30–45 sec (fragrant).</li>
                    <li>Add crushed tomatoes (28 oz/800 g), tomato sauce (15 oz/425 g), 2 Tbsp tomato paste, 1–2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, ½ tsp crushed fennel seeds, ¼–½ tsp black pepper, and ½ cup water.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a simmer, then reduce to low and simmer 20–30 min, partially covered, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be thick but spoonable. Taste and adjust salt/sugar.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cook the noodles (if not using no-boil)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boil 12–14 lasagna noodles in well-salted water until very al dente (about 1–2 min shy of package time; usually 6–7 min).</li>
                    <li>Drain, rinse briefly under cool water, and lay flat on a lightly oiled tray so they don’t stick. Pat dry before layering.</li>
                    <li>Using no-boil noodles? Skip boiling, stir an extra ½ cup water into your sauce, and plan to bake 10 min longer covered.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Set up your cheeses</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ricotta layer: the ricotta mixture you made in step 1. If it feels stiff, loosen with 2–3 Tbsp milk.</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella: divide into three portions (for two inner layers + top).</li>
                    <li>Parmesan: reserve about ½ cup for sprinkling between layers and on top.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Assemble the layers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Base: Spread 1½ cups meat sauce in the dish.</li>
                    <li>Layer 1: 6 noodles (slightly overlapping) → ½ of the ricotta mixture (spread gently to edges) → ⅓ of the mozzarella → 1½ cups sauce → ¼ cup Parmesan.</li>
                    <li>Layer 2: Repeat the same: noodles → remaining ½ ricotta → ⅓ mozzarella → 1½ cups sauce → ¼ cup Parmesan.</li>
                    <li>Top: Final layer of noodles → a thin blanket of sauce (use what’s left) → remaining mozzarella + Parmesan. Leave a small ½ cm border bare around the edges to reduce boil-over.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bake</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the dish tented with foil (lightly oil/spray the foil underside so it won’t stick to the cheese).</li>
                    <li>Bake 25 minutes covered, then remove foil and bake 20–25 minutes more until bubbling around the edges and the top is lightly golden. (Optional: broil 1–2 min at the end for extra color—watch closely.)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Rest & serve</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let the lasagna rest 15–20 minutes before cutting—this sets the layers so slices hold together.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.</li>
                </ul>
